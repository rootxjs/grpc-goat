# gRPC Basics

This guide covers the fundamental concepts of gRPC that you need to understand before diving into the security labs. Whether you're new to gRPC or need a refresher, this section will provide the foundation for understanding the vulnerabilities demonstrated in gRPC Goat.

## What is gRPC?

gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls) is a modern, open-source, high-performance RPC framework developed by Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features like authentication, bidirectional streaming, flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts.

### Key Advantages

- **High Performance**: Built on HTTP/2 with binary serialization
- **Language Agnostic**: Supports multiple programming languages
- **Streaming Support**: Bidirectional streaming capabilities
- **Strong Typing**: Protocol Buffers provide type safety
- **Built-in Security**: Native TLS support and authentication mechanisms

## Core Concepts

### Protocol Buffers (protobuf)

Protocol Buffers are a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. They define service contracts and message formats, and generate client and server code in multiple languages.

**Example Service Definition:**
```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package userservice;

service UserService {
  rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (GetUserResponse);
  rpc ListUsers(ListUsersRequest) returns (stream User);
  rpc CreateUser(CreateUserRequest) returns (CreateUserResponse);
}

message GetUserRequest {
  string user_id = 1;
}

message GetUserResponse {
  User user = 1;
  bool success = 2;
  string message = 3;
}

message User {
  string id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  string email = 3;
  repeated string roles = 4;
}
```

### Communication Patterns

gRPC supports four types of service methods:

**Unary RPC**
- Single request, single response
- Most common pattern, similar to HTTP REST calls
```protobuf
rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (GetUserResponse);
```

**Server Streaming**
- Single request, stream of responses
- Useful for real-time data feeds
```protobuf
rpc ListUsers(ListUsersRequest) returns (stream User);
```

**Client Streaming**
- Stream of requests, single response
- Useful for uploading data or batch operations
```protobuf
rpc CreateUsers(stream CreateUserRequest) returns (CreateUsersResponse);
```

**Bidirectional Streaming**
- Stream of requests and responses
- Enables real-time communication
```protobuf
rpc ChatStream(stream ChatMessage) returns (stream ChatMessage);
```

## Security Fundamentals

Understanding gRPC security is crucial for both attacking and defending gRPC services. Here are the key security concepts:

### Transport Security

**TLS/SSL Encryption**
- Encrypts data in transit between client and server
- Prevents eavesdropping and tampering
- Should always be enabled in production

**Mutual TLS (mTLS)**
- Both client and server authenticate each other using certificates
- Provides strong authentication for service-to-service communication
- Requires proper certificate management

### Authentication Methods

**Token-based Authentication**
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- OAuth2 access tokens
- API keys in metadata

**Certificate-based Authentication**
- Client certificates for mTLS
- Certificate validation and trust chains
- Certificate revocation handling

### Authorization

**Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Define roles and permissions
- Validate user roles before processing requests
- Implement fine-grained access controls

**Method-level Authorization**
- Different permissions for different gRPC methods
- Context-aware authorization decisions
- Audit logging for access attempts

## Common Security Vulnerabilities

The gRPC Goat labs demonstrate these common security issues:

### Configuration Issues
- **gRPC Reflection Enabled**: Exposes service definitions in production
- **Insecure TLS**: Self-signed certificates or weak configurations
- **Improper mTLS**: Accepting any client certificate

### Authentication Bypasses
- **Plaintext Communications**: No encryption for sensitive data
- **Weak Certificate Validation**: Insufficient certificate checks
- **Missing Authentication**: Unprotected admin endpoints

### Input Validation Failures
- **SQL Injection**: Unsanitized database queries
- **Command Injection**: Unsafe system command execution
- **SSRF**: Unvalidated URL requests

### Infrastructure Misconfigurations
- **Unix Socket Permissions**: World-writable sockets
- **Network Exposure**: Services accessible from unintended networks

## Testing Tools

### Command Line Tools

**grpcurl**
- Command-line tool for interacting with gRPC services
- Supports reflection, metadata, and various authentication methods
```bash
# List services
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:8080 list

# Call a method
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"name": "John"}' localhost:8080 userservice.UserService/GetUser
```

**ghz**
- gRPC benchmarking and load testing tool
- Useful for performance testing and stress testing
```bash
# Load test a service
ghz --insecure --proto user.proto --call userservice.UserService.GetUser \
    -d '{"user_id": "123"}' localhost:8080
```

**evans**
- Interactive gRPC client with REPL interface
- Great for exploring services and testing during development
```bash
# Start interactive session
evans --host localhost --port 8080 --reflection
```

### GUI Applications

**Postman**
- Popular API client with gRPC support (v8.5.0+)
- Visual interface for building and testing requests
- Collection management and team collaboration

**BloomRPC**
- Cross-platform gRPC client with GUI interface
- Simple and intuitive interface for gRPC testing
- Supports reflection and custom metadata

**Kreya**
- Modern gRPC and REST API client
- Advanced features for API testing and debugging
- Environment management and scripting support

**Insomnia**
- API client with gRPC support
- Plugin ecosystem and team features
- GraphQL and REST support alongside gRPC

# gRPC Goat Labs

Welcome to the gRPC Goat vulnerability labs! Each lab demonstrates a specific security vulnerability commonly found in real-world gRPC applications. These hands-on exercises will help you understand both how to exploit these vulnerabilities and how to defend against them.

<Aside type="tip">
**Getting Started**: Each lab is designed to be completed independently. Start with Lab 001 for beginners or jump to any specific vulnerability you want to explore.
</Aside>

## Vulnerability Overview

The following table provides an overview of all available labs, their business context, and the security risks they demonstrate:

| Lab | Service Name | Business Purpose | Vulnerability | Risk / Impact |
|-----|--------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **001** | **Service Discovery** | Internal API registry for developers | **Reflection Enabled** | Attackers can enumerate all gRPC services and hidden methods, discovering sensitive endpoints like admin functions |
| **002** | **Auth Service** | Handles user login and session tokens | **Plaintext gRPC** | Credentials sent over plaintext can be intercepted and reused by attackers |
| **003** | **Billing Service** | Processes customer payments | **Insecure TLS** | Self-signed TLS allows MITM attacks and interception/manipulation of transactions |
| **004** | **Partner API** | Exposes partner integrations | **Arbitrary mTLS** | Accepts any client certificate, letting attackers impersonate trusted partners and access restricted APIs |
| **005** | **Partner API v2** | Enhanced partner integrations | **mTLS Subject Validation** | Validates subject name but accepts self-signed certificates, allowing certificate impersonation |
| **006** | **Admin Service** | System administration functions | **Unix Socket World Writable** | Socket with world read/write permissions allows any user to access admin functions |
| **007** | **User Directory** | Stores employee profiles and permissions | **SQL Injection** | Unsanitized database queries allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data (users, credentials, API keys) |
| **008** | **File Processor** | Processes uploaded files for reports | **Command Injection** | Unsanitized input allows attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the server |
| **009** | **Image Preview** | Fetches thumbnails from external URLs | **SSRF** | Attackers can make the server request internal resources, potentially accessing metadata or internal endpoints |

## Lab Categories

### Discovery & Enumeration
- **Lab 001**: Service Discovery - Learn how gRPC reflection can expose your entire API surface

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Lab 002**: Auth Service - Understand the risks of plaintext gRPC communications
- **Lab 004**: Partner API - Explore mTLS misconfigurations
- **Lab 005**: Partner API v2 - Advanced certificate validation bypasses

### Transport Security
- **Lab 003**: Billing Service - TLS implementation vulnerabilities
- **Lab 006**: Admin Service - Unix socket permission issues

### Injection Attacks
- **Lab 007**: User Directory - SQL injection in gRPC services
- **Lab 008**: File Processor - Command injection vulnerabilities
- **Lab 009**: Image Preview - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

<Aside type="caution">
**Security Notice**: These labs contain intentionally vulnerable code for educational purposes. Never deploy this code in production environments.

## Learning Path

### For Beginners
Start with these foundational labs to understand basic gRPC security concepts:
1. **Lab 001** - gRPC Reflection (easiest to understand and exploit)
2. **Lab 002** - Plaintext Communications (demonstrates basic transport security)
3. **Lab 007** - SQL Injection (familiar vulnerability in gRPC context)

### For Intermediate Users
Explore authentication and transport security issues:
1. **Lab 003** - Insecure TLS Implementation
2. **Lab 004** - mTLS Misconfigurations
3. **Lab 006** - Unix Socket Permissions

### For Advanced Users
Tackle complex vulnerabilities and advanced attack scenarios:
1. **Lab 005** - Advanced Certificate Validation Bypasses
2. **Lab 008** - Command Injection in gRPC Services
3. **Lab 009** - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a lab** from the table above based on your experience level
2. **Set up the environment** following the [installation guide](/docs/grpc_goat_docs/getting-started)
3. **Follow the lab instructions** to exploit the vulnerability
4. **Study the mitigation** techniques to secure your own gRPC services
5. **Practice with different tools** like Postman, grpcurl, or BloomRPC

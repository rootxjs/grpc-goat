# gRPC Goat

gRPC Goat is a "Vulnerable by Design" lab created to provide an interactive, hands-on playground for learning and practicing gRPC security.

Each lab contains a **CTF-style flag** that you can capture by successfully exploiting the vulnerability!

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rootxjs/grpc-goat.git
cd grpc-goat

# Start all vulnerable services
docker compose up --build

# Services will be available on localhost:8001-8009
```
